# online-exam-loopholes
This repository compiles a couple of methods to cheat in an online exam, which involves a Personal Phone/Computer, preferably not inside a campus/college. 
Note: I DO NOT condone cheating as a valid option to pass in exams, but my college usually gives out all the questions w/ answers in advance, so I can develop this repository guilt-free.

Feel free to contribute.
It is basically impractical to mitigate all the loopholes simultaneously, which is why making these open source doesn't really hurt anyone.


# Camera method

1. Setting up a virtual camera in which a short video with your face in it will be looped through for as long as the exam lasts.

This method is tested under Linux and Windows. 

Dependencies:

- Ubuntu 17.04 and above
- Windows 10 1803+

- Download the latest OBS Studio (prefferably the Git version)
